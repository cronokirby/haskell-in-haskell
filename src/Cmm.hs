-- | This module contains the intermediate code generator between STG and C
--
-- The reason this exists is primarily to simplify code generation. You could
-- generate C directly from STG, but this leads to more complicated code.
-- The primary mixing of concerns is that of translating the STG semantics into
-- static information, and ordering that information into actual C. For example,
-- all we need to know from a `let` binding is what kind of things get allocated,
-- and how many. If you generate C directly, you mix the calculation of this
-- information with its usage to generate C code. By separating these two parts,
-- you make both of them much simpler.
--
-- Having a separate stage makes it much easier to generate better C code, since
-- you can easily translate the STG into simple imperative statements, and then
-- analyze those to generate nicer C code.
