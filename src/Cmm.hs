-- | This module contains the intermediate code generator between STG and C
--
-- The reason this exists is primarily to simplify code generation. You could
-- generate C directly from STG, but this leads to more complicated code.
-- The primary mixing of concerns is that of translating the STG semantics into
-- static information, and ordering that information into actual C. For example,
-- all we need to know from a `let` binding is what kind of things get allocated,
-- and how many. If you generate C directly, you mix the calculation of this
-- information with its usage to generate C code. By separating these two parts,
-- you make both of them much simpler.
--
-- Having a separate stage makes it much easier to generate better C code, since
-- you can easily translate the STG into simple imperative statements, and then
-- analyze those to generate nicer C code.

import Ourlude

-- | Represents a name we can give to a function
--
-- The individual pieces of a function may not be unique,
-- but if we look at the nested tree of functions and their
-- subfunctions, then we get unique paths.
data FunctionName
  = -- | A standard function name
    StringFunction String
  | -- | A name we can use for the alternatives inside of a function
    Alts

type Index = Int

-- | Represents what type of storage some variable will need
--
-- We can figure this out the first time a variable is used, and then
-- use that information in nested closures to figure out how they're going
-- to access this variable that they've captured
data Storage
  = -- | This variable will be stored in a pointer
    PointerStorage
  | -- | This variable will be stored as an int, with 64 bits
    IntStorage
  | -- | This variable will be stored as a string
    StringStorage
  | -- | This variable is a global function with a certain index
    --
    -- When a variable references a global function, we don't need
    -- to store it alongside the closure, since it can just reference it
    -- directly
    GlobalStorage Index

-- | A location allows us to reference some value concretely
data Location
  = -- | This variable is the nth pointer arg passed to us on the stack
    Arg Index
  | -- | This variable is the nth pointer bound in this closure
    Bound Index
  | -- | This variable is the nth int bound in this closure
    BoundInt Index
  | -- | This variable is the nth string bound in this closure
    BoundString Index
  | -- | This variable is just a global function
    Global Index

-- | Represents a function.
--
-- Functions are the units of execution, but have a bunch of "metadata"
-- associated with them, and can also potentially have subfunctions.
data Function = Function
  { -- | The name of the function
    functionName :: FunctionName,
    -- | If an index is present, then this function corresponds to a certain global index
    --
    -- We do things this way, that way we can traverse the function tree to build up
    -- a table of index functions to fully resolved function names. Trying
    -- to generate the fully resolved function name at this stage would be annoying.
